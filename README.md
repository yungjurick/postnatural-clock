# The Postnatural Timer - Weight of Time

As humans, it is easy to believe that we see weight of time based on our human experience. A second as a second for humans, a minute as a minute for humans, and an hour as an hour for humans.

Then, what would be the weight of time for other animals - such as a mouse, a dog, a tortoise, and a whale, or even waste? These are just a few of the many selections, but what would it be like to see their time through the perception of human time? What would our 1 second, 1 minute, or 1 hour be equivalent for this animals and waste?

Based on the average lifespan of these animals (including humans) and time it takes these waste to decompose, this timer tries to portray how their time be portrayed through a human perspective. For instance, 1 second of human time would be 7 seconds for a dog if their time was to be reinterpreted in human perception of time.
